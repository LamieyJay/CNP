## Cable network optimization using shortest path algorithms

This project was done as a capstone project during my Master's in Engineering management. 

In this project, we create a program that compares 2 cable network design methods. The first method compares three shortest path algorithms, calculating the weight of the entire network when the cables are laid individually. While the second method involves creating shared paths for the cables, and then calculating the total network weight.
